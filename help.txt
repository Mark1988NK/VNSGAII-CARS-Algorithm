the information of raw.mat:
X1 : the spectrum from the first batch of biotransformation
X2 : the spectrum from the second batch of biotransformation
Y1 : the concentration of L-Glu and GABA in the first batch of biotransformation, the first column is the concentration of L-Glu and the second column is the concentration of GABA
Y2 : the concentration of L-Glu and GABA in the second batch of biotransformation, the first column is the concentration of L-Glu and the second column is the concentration of GABA
sel: the selected spectra points apart from the noise part from the interference of water 
Wavenum : the Wave number of the spectra

1. to run main1 to get the result of mulcalint30preder1detrend.mat

this step last too long, so we provided the result mulcalint30preder1detrend.mat as to skip the first main1 to continue the main2.

2. to run main2 

get the PLS models of GABA and L-Glu on under 30 equidistant intervals and Der1 + Detrend pretreatment.

3. to run main3

get the  pareto front solutions for multi-objective optimization of the GABA/Glu PLS models

4. to run main4

get the Regression coefficient for GABA and Glu

5. to run main5

to run competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm under selected intervals by multi-objective optimization

6. to run main6

In order to maintain consistency with the results of the paper, you can skip main5 to directly load CARSresult.mat

Main6 is to show the selected points given by CARS
